# Before Everything a Message from me (vky5)

I really do stuff for engineering part of it. I don't know if I will be able to monetize it or not. I am not sure if anyone will use it or not. But what I am really concern about is the engineering part of it. I am just testing my own limits in limited resources. This may not be the best way to do it but I am just doing it for the sake of building something that excits me. 

I am gonna document my journey here in my own language be it hindi, english or broken english lol. I don't care about it. I just want to document it for myself and for anyone who is interested in this journey.
