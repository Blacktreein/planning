# The two projects

before anyone assume I am again abandoning this project nah. I am gonna build this project into two part. 


### Project 1: API Bundler 
This is gonna be the first part of blacktree. This is gonna be the API bundler. The main part in which developers can bundle their APIs from their github repo and host it on our servers. This is gonna be also the main part of the blacktree. 

### Project 2: API Marketplace
This is gonna be the marketplace part. Users can subscribe to the APIs and use it in their projects. This is gonna be the part where users can manage their subscriptions and get access to the APIs.
