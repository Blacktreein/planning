### **BlackTree Rating System Proposal**

1. **Purpose:**  
    To evaluate users' contributions (posts, solutions, comments) and establish credibility within the platform.
    
2. **Components:**
    
    - **Post Rating:** Users can upvote or downvote posts based on quality and relevance.
    - **Solution Rating:** Users can rate solutions based on clarity, efficiency, and correctness.
    - **User Reputation:** A cumulative score based on contributions and peer feedback.
3. **Scoring System:**
    
    - **Upvote:** +10 points
    - **Downvote:** -5 points
    - **Best Solution Tag:** +50 points (for solutions marked as "Best" by the post owner or community votes)
    - **Comment Likes:** +2 points per like
4. **Reputation Tiers:**
    
    - **Newbie (0–100):** Limited posting and commenting rights.
    - **Contributor (101–500):** Can create posts and solutions freely.
    - **Expert (501–1000):** Can tag posts, moderate discussions, and highlight high-quality solutions.
    - **Mentor (1000+):** Can review/report posts and mentor users directly.
5. **Decay Mechanism:**
    - Inactive accounts lose 5% of their reputation monthly to encourage consistent engagement.
6. **Abuse Prevention:**
    - Voting power increases with reputation.
    - Anti-spam detection to prevent vote manipulation.
