let's talk about ranks
A person could be excellent in frontend dev but terrible backend dev. What will be the basis of giving rank. Is it overall developer talent and if so what about the tags. How will they get the paid project. I think the best option is to rate each dev based on their contribution in the tags that they have worked on.
